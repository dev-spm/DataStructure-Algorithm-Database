## LINKED LIST- Underlying data structure is Doubly Linked List- Insertion Order preserved- Duplicate element allowed- Heterogeneous data can be stored- Null Insertion is Possible- It implements Serializable and Cloneable Interface but not RandomAccess Interface- It is the best choice if our frequent operation is Insertion or Deletion in the middle- It is the worst Choice if our frequent operation is Retrieval Operation- Extends AbstractList class and Implements a Doubly Linked List- Maintain Insertion Order- It is usually used for Stack(LIFO) and Queue(FIFO)## methods- addFirst- addLast## How LinkedList works internally- LinkedList data is stored inside a node- Each node contains the reference to the next element and previous element- If the frequent operation is insertion and deletion at the middle, then collections.linkedList is recommended- Linked list used Node class internally to store data- Node have 3 elements    - Element    - Node<E> Next    - Node<E> Previous- https://www.journaldev.com/13386/java-linkedlist-linkedlist-java- https://javahungry.blogspot.com/2021/01/internal-implementation-of-linkedlist.html## Representation of Linked List- Let's see how each node of the linked list is represented. Each node consists:- A data item- An address of another node- We wrap both the data item and the next node reference in a struct as:```// Linked list implementation in Javaclass LinkedList {  // Creating a node  Node head;  static class Node {    int value;    Node next;    Node(int d) {      value = d;      next = null;    }  }```## Linked List Applications- Dynamic memory allocation- Implemented in stack and queue- In undo functionality of pieces of software- Hash tables, Graphs
