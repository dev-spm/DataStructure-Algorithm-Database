# Writing Professional Email 
## How to assign tasks in email
- 3W’s
  - Who  - Name of a specific person(Not a group)
  - What - Explicit description (No )
  - When -  Exact date and time

## Who
- This is basically name of the person. When you are asking someone to complete your task, you should start your name, not to the group of people. 
- Bad Example
```
 Hi Team,
    I need you to do this task for me.
```
- Good Example
```
Hi John,
    I need you to do the below task for me.
Other details.
```

- Bad Example

```
Hi John, Peter, Jim,
    I want you to do the task for me.
```
- Good Example
```
Hi John,
    I want you to proceed with the below task and if you need. Peter and Jim can help you.
```
## What
- This is the description of the exact task you need someone to do.
- Don’t be ambiguous and avoid making any assumptions.
- The idea is to be very clear about what needs to get done
- Bad example
```
Susan,
    Please update the attachment and send it back to me.
```
- Good Example
```
Hi Susan,
    Please update the Slides 4 and 5 of the attached powerpoint presentation(using the tables and data we agreed to on last week’s call ) and send me the revised version
```
## When
- This refers to the. Exact time and date a task needs to be completed.
- Bad Example
```
    Michael,
    I need this in the next few days.
```
- Good Example
```
    Michael,
    I need this sent back to me by Thursday. July 16 at 1:00 pm US Easter standard time
```
## Tip 1 : Use Who, What and when in your email
- Eg : Michael - need your report by tomorrow
- A good habit is to also type[Action] at the beginning of the subject line to stress importance
- Eg : [Action] JIM, reminder to send slides by tomorrow

## Tip 2 : Use prefix modifiers
- If the email is not an action-oriented one(I.e the 3W’s don’t apply), then add prefix modifier URGENT, CONFIDENTIAL, IMP. OR FYI in the subject line
- Make sure you include the prefix at the beginning of the subject line because it might missed at the end
  - Bad Example
  - Info regarding your June 9 trip before you leave [URGENT]
- Good example
  - [Urgent] info regarding your June 9th trip before you leave

## Tip 3 : Write the entire email
- If Your email is extremely short, then use the subject. Line itself as the entire email. Suffix it with EOM, which stands for End Of message
- EG1 :  Sunil- the. Team decided on the Cheesecake Factory for lunch @1pm <EOM>
- Eg2 : Quick Question : did you upgrade to. The latest  version of IOS ? <EOM>
## Tip 4 : Change the subject only when required

- Write email that are five sentences or less [TL, DR]
- Advantages of shorter emails
  1. Faster Replies  
  2. Less fluff  

## Tips to write shorter emails
- Know what you want
- Get to the point immediately
- Start with the most important message first
- Highlight a lack of required response or action
- If you don’t need or expect a reply to your email, state that in your message as well
- At the beginning of such mail I usually type
- FYI(For your information )
- NNTR(No Need to reply)
- A similar one - No Action Required

## Break Emails into 2 parts
1. Quick Summary : Label the first part of. Your email with a quick summary sub heading.
   This quick summary section should be five sentences or less, so the tips in the. Previous lesson. Apply. Here. It should summarise. The main. Points of. Your long email and state all action so that they are not. Buried in your message.
   If there are no actions needed then state that in this section

2.  Details. : Label the second part of your email with a details,  background or supporting Information subheading
    That is where you write out. All the additional information that supports your. Summary
    Don’t shy away. From repeating. Information. That was in the quick summary section. In fact, doing so helps reinforce the points again
    The objective of this second is to add more colour or details to your summary section

- The objective of these sections to add  more colour or details to your summary section

- Example
```
    Sub : Update & Actions after meeting with customer today
    Body
    
    Team,
    I had a meeting with customer today. Here is what happened
    
    Quick Summary
    Mike is pleased with our progress. Here are the next steps
```

## Details
- I met with mike….

## How to Make your emails Scannable
- Why make Emails scannable ?
- To make your readers focus. On the stuffs that matters in your message

## Tip 1 : User bullet points For all your action & questions
```
    * James : Do this
    * Peter : do this
    * Sadfasda
```
## Make bullet points for questions asked in email one by one

## Tip 2 : Use subheading & White space
- Use Quick summary, details, next steps, financials, actions, meeting details
- Example
```
    Quick Summary
    Asdkjasldjalsdasd
    …
    
    Next Steps
    …
    
    Meeting Overview
    …
```
## Tip3 :  Use highlight and/ or bold text
- Use highlight for Important dates, important person, action
- Attach Screenshots
- Instead of writing full explanation, attach screenshots
- They save you a ton. Of  time to understand
- They make life of receiver easy

## When to use Screenshots
- To show someone where to go on a website
- TO give someone step-by -step instructions about a process
- To highlight a specific slide in an attached PowerPoint deck.
- To someone an error message
- MAC -> CMD+SHIFT+5
- Windows -> Using PrintScreen

## Spell out time zones
- Mention the exact time zone, day and date that you are referring tot
- www.timeanddate.com
- Bad Example - where timezone not mentioned
```
    Hi Susan,
    Can we meet tomorrow 9:30 ?
```
- This is very confusing

- Right way
```
Hi Susan,
    Can we meet tomorrow, Tuesday, May 29, 2022 at 9:30 am US Eastern time to discuss this.
    
    Regards,
``` 
## Spell out acronyms
- Spell out acronyms at least once in your email, if you are not t100% sure that everyone copied know the acronyms mean
- PM, can be project manager or product manager,
- Better to write in full - Project tManager

## Use IF…THEN statements
- They reduce the amount of follow-up emails you have write
- They clarify expectations and assumptions so that there is absolutely no confusion by your side
- They hold people accountable for getting back tot you in certain date or time
- Example
```
    Michale - we are leaving today at 5:30 pm. If you can not be here at the at time, then please meet us directly at the restaurant by 6:00 PM.
```

## Present Options instead of asking open-ended questions
- bad example
- What will be the suitable time to deliver the project ?
- Good Example
- What will be the suitable timeline to finish the assignment ?
  - Next Week
  - this week
  - 3 weeks

## R-read your email once for a content check
## Save Drafts of repetitive emails
- Some time we need to send emails frequently to our team members, instead of writing everytime, save a format in draft and use it everytime
- Write it now, send it later using delay delivery

## Reply All
- Golden Rule -> Don’t use reply all when only the original sender needs to read your message
- If you are answering a question, responding with courtesy phrase, or sharing a problem that only applies to you, then don’t reply all 
- Don't use reply all in Some phrases, congrats, thank you, I agree

## Mention when you are removing members from the reply all list
- In situations when you want to reply back but only include a subset of original reply all list, you. Should clearly state whom you are removing and why
- Eg
```
    Removing Jim & Jay , so I don’t clog their inbox.
    Removing the customer for confidentiality
```
- State the Phrase at the beginning of your email message so that it’s not missed.

## Reply to Questions Inline
- Eg
```
    What hotel are we staying at in Miami ? - **The Claton Hotel**
    What Charge code should we use ?  **Use code ABCD**
    Are you renting a car or taking a cab ? **We’ll be renting a car.**
    
    You can use different colour(Blue, green or yellow) instead of Bold above
```


## Reply immediately to Time-Sensitive Emails
- Don’t reply just an Okay unless it make sense.
- Eg
```
    Okay, I will get this done by 2:30 pm Central time today.
    Sure, I will reply back to your questions before the deadline.
    Acknowledged - I will try. My best, but no promise
    Will do, I will forward the attachment in the next two hours when I am back at my desk.
```
## Read The latest email on a thread before responding

## Auto Reply (Perfect Out Of Office) Reply
-  The first rule of an OOO reply is that you should set one up
- Write meaning full why you are away
  Eg : Hello, I will be out of the office on Thursday, 4th Aug,  2022 and will be return to office by Monday, 10th. August, 2022.

## Rules
