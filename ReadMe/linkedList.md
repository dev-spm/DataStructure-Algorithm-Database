## LINKEDLIST- Underlying data structure is Doubly Linked List- Insertion Order preserved- Duplicate element allowed- Heterogeneous data can be stored- Null Insertion is Possible- It implements Serializable and Cloneable Interface but not RandomAccess Interface- It is the best choice if our frequent operation is Insertion or Deletion in the middle- It is worst Choice if our frequent operation is Retrieval Operation- Extends AbstractList class and Implements a Doubly Linked List- Maintain Insertion Order- It is usually used for Stack(LIFO) and Queue(FIFO)## methods- addFirst- addLast## How LinkedList works internally- LinkedList data is stored inside a node- Each node contains the reference to the next element and previous element- If the frequent operation is insertion and deletion at the middle, then linkedList is recommended- Linked list used Node class internally to store data- Node have 3 elements    - Element    - Node<E> Next    - Node<E> Previous- https://www.journaldev.com/13386/java-linkedlist-linkedlist-java
